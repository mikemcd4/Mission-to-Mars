# Mission to Mars Webscraping

## Overview

In this activity, I created a webscraping tool utilizing beautifulSoup and Splinter to gather the latest information and news article about the Mission to Mars. I used MongoDB to store the data that was scraped, and then used Flask to display the information. HTML and Bootstrap were used to format the information in a viewer-friendly way.
